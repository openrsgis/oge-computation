# Structure of the project

There are three main parts of the project:

- oge-computation-commmon - contains common code for the computation, including config, entity, object storage tools.
- oge-computation-core - core implementation of the computation. 
- oge-computation-plugin - plugin for the computation.

## oge-computation-common

## oge-computation-core
./oge-computation-core/src/main/scala/whu/edu/cn/oge/Coverage.scala includes the coverage operators, and the Feature.scala in the same path includes the feature operators.

## oge-computation-plugin
